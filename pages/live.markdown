We are planning to plug the event directly to the Web with live streaming of talks and Twitter feeds for comments (besides comments on talk pages). This page serves as a connection point.

<div class="row">
<!--
  Consider making a nice separate page for twitter feeds and putting it on a page
  <a href="twitter_gbconf2015.html"  onclick="window.open('twitter_gbconf2015.html', 'newwindow', 'width=300, height=400'); return false;">Open feed on separate window</a> -->
     <div class="col-lg-6">
        {% include twitter_gbconf2015.html %}
     </div>
     <div class="col-lg-6">
        {% include twitter_globalbrain.html %}
     </div>
</div>
