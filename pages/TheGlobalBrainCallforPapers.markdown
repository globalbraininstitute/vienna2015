##Conference track theme



The [Global Brain](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_brain) can be defined as the self-organizing network formed by all
people on this planet together with the information and communication
technologies that connect and support them. As
the [Internet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) becomes faster, smarter, and more encompassing, it
increasingly links its users into a single information processing
system, which functions like a nervous system for the planet Earth.
The intelligence of this system is [collective](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence) and [distributed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_cognition): it is not localized in any particular individual,
organization or computer system. It rather emerges from the interactions between all its
components—a property characteristic of a [complex adaptive
system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_systems). Such a distributed intelligence may be able to tackle
current and emerging global problems that have eluded more traditional
approaches. Yet, at the same time it will create technological and
social challenges that are still difficult to imagine, transforming our
society in all aspects.

###Invited Speaker

-   Prof. Francis Heylighen, director of the [Global Brain
    Institute](http://www.globalbraininstitute.org), Vrije Universiteit, Brussel

 
###Subject and Scope

The concept of the Global Brain touches a wide variety
of issues concerned with the large-scale impact of information
technologies on society. We give priority to interdisciplinary research
that integrates different levels, applications and domains, so as to
provide a long-term vision of the future.  Possible topics include, but
are not limited to, the following:


-   Futuristic socio-economic paradigms. 
-   Applications of collective intelligence for
    tackling  global challenges.
-   Sociotechnological evolution, trends, and
    patterns.
-   Distributed governance, decision-making, and
    democracy.
-   Knowledge-based civilization.
-   Privacy, security, freedom and ethics in the
    information age.
-   Relationship between the Global Brain and the
    individual.
-   Information systems and technologies with global
    impact:
    -   <span class="c4">Internet of Things </span>
    -   <span class="c4">Semantic Web.</span>
    -   <span class="c4">MOOCs and other online education technologies,
        </span>
    -   <span class="c4">Global healthcare management</span>
    -   <span class="c4">Smart Grids</span>
    -   <span class="c4">Human - machine interfaces</span><span
        class="c4"> and </span><span class="c4">convergence</span><span
        class="c4">.</span>
    -   <span class="c4">Artificial Intelligence</span>
    -   <span class="c4">...        </span>

##Format


The conference track will have 3 parts:

1. Keynote talk by Prof. Francis Heylighen
2. Paper presentation session (including Q&A).
3. Free discussion session. 

###Paper submission


Contributors are invited to submit a one page abstract with links
and references. The authors whose abstracts are selected by the
scientific committee will be invited to present their work in the paper
session.  (Notice that we require abstracts which are substantially
shorter than what is indicated in the general conference submission page
\~750 words)

Abstracts are submitted from the [conference submission
page](http://summit.is4is.org/submission).
Please follow the instructions there. (When prompted to do
so, you should select “ISIS Summit Vienna 2015” as the conference name
and “The Global Brain” as the track name.)

Following the conference, authors will be invited to submit their
full paper for a special issue of the Web of Science -listed journal
[Technological Forecasting & Social
Change](http://www.elsevier.com/locate/techfore) (or
to a number of other publications offered by the IS4IS summit
organizers). The full paper will be subject to a
peer-review according to the standards of the journal.



###Important dates


* Deadline for abstract submission: **February 15, 2015**

* Notice of acceptance:  **March  20, 2015**

* Conference dates: **June 3-7, 2015**
