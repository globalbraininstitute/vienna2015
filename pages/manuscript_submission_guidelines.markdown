It seems that the best way to format the extended article according the required [template](http://sci.fo/isisword) of Is4Is summit is the manual copy-pasting of the text paragraph by paragraph. Unfortunately. Below are the steps for the effort involved that are proven to work. Probably there are other methods of aplying the template (e.g. applying it to the existing file), but I would advice not to do that unless you are an expert in MS Word. [Here](http://sciforum.net/conference/isis-summit-vienna-2015/page/instructions) are original instructions from Is4Is (look under *Extended Abstract Format*).

**Step 1:** Download the [template](http://sci.fo/isisword) and open it with MS Word. This will open a new document based on template file (.dot).

**Step 2:** Save the opened file to a "real" document you will want to edit with `File` -> `Save As` -> `Word Document`. This step should produce a file with *.docx or *.doc extension depending on the Word version used.

**Step 3:** Prepare a hyper-speedy copy-pasting workspace:

**Sub-Step 3.1:** Open the newly created file (will call *manuscript* further);

**Sub-Step 3.2:** Open your abstract which is to be formatted (will call *original* further);

**Sub-Step 3.3:** Display both documents side-by-side with `View` -> `View Side by Side` (this is not really necessary, but very convienent for otherwise frustrating jumping from one window to another while copy-pasting). You should have something like that:

{: .center}
![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/misc/side_by_side_view.png){: width="50%"}

**Step 4:** Copy the title, authors, addresses, the text of the abstract and references from the *original* to *manuscript*. There are two options how to do that and I will explain both:

**Option 1: Using style selector:**

* Copy the paragraphs where they belong wihtout thinking too much about the "local" formatting (explained in option 2). Chances are, that some paragraphs will carry their formatting togehter with the 'end of paragraph' symbol. Also, the copied text may not be attached to the appropriate style (defined by the template). Let them.

* Apply the appropriate styles to the appropriate paragraphs with the Word style selector. The styles required by the Is4Is are prefixed with **M_** in the template (i.e. **M_title**, **M_text**, etc.);

* The style selector (at least in Word 2007) is accessible here:

{: .center}
![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/misc/style_selector.png){: width="50%"}

* And looks like this (see **M_everything** styles):

{: .center}
![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/misc/styles_toolbar.png){: width="25%"}

* Having all this, the formatting is assigned by selecting (or just placing the cursor on) the appropriate paragraph and after after that clicking on the needed style in the "Style toolbar"  (see screenshot above).

**Option 2: Trying to avoid style selector (needs some precision):**

* First, enable what is called "show paragraph marks and other hidden formatting symbols". This is done by pressing &#182; symbol somewhere in the `Home` toolbar (as shown below for Word 2010). It is a good idea to do that for both the *manuscript* and the *source*.

{: .center}
![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/misc/formatting_sign.png){: width="50%"}

* Now, just copy paragraphs from the *original* to the *manuscript* to where they belong. The reason of having the  &#182; symbol is in order **not to copy it**. The World is keeping all the formatting of the text in the paragraph symbol (see [here](http://word.tips.net/T000168_Understanding_How_Word_Stores_Paragraph_Formatting.html) for more). Therefore, if you are not using World styles from the beginning (and I have learned that quite some people do not), it makes sense of being wary of the &#182; symbol in order not to copy the local formatting which messes things up considerably...

* My own way is to use **Option 2** initially but then still check the styles using **Option 1**....

Hope this helps. Please use comments in case I made something more complicated than it really is...
