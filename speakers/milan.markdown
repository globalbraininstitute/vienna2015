## Big Data and the understanding of the political

### Abstract

Big Data  increasingly  pervade  all  spheres  of  the  contemporary  society. Social  media  have  turned  into  the  biggest  ever  machine  to  gather  data about  social behavior and preferences, where users voluntarily disclose post-demographic  data.  Law  enforcement  and  government  agencies collect  large  amounts  of  data  concerning  nearly  every  movement  of their  citizens.  Digital  artifacts  and  devices  increasingly  have  social consequences.  How  do  massive  data  collection  by  state  actors  and  the private sector alike shape our understanding of the political? 

The  Snowden revelations  have  prompted  citizens to  become increasingly  aware  of  the  critical  role  of  information  as  the  new  fabric of  social  life.  This  awareness  has  triggered  new  forms  of  civic engagement  and  political  action,  which  alter  and  augment  citizens’ democratic agency. A variety of socio-technical practices, which I have termed  ‘data  activism’,  emerge  in  the  fringes  of  the  modern  society  to impact  the  way  massive  data  collection  is  perceived,  opposed  or leveraged. Data  activism  has  a  critical  approach  to  big  data  at  its  core, whereby  massive  data  collection  is  seen  as  both  a  challenge  to individual  rights,  and  a  novel  set  of  opportunities  for  social  change.  It appropriates  and  subverts  technological  innovation  and  software,  as well  as  their  language  and  epistemological  approach,  for  political  or social  change  purposes.  It  concerns  both  individuals  and  groups,  and operates at different territorial levels, from local to transnational. 

My  presentation  will  explore  how  the  emerging  data  epistemology alters  our  understanding  of  the  political,  and  of  democratic  agency  in particular.  It will  offer  the  notion  of  data  activism  as  a  heuristic  tool  to think  politically  about  big  data  and  massive  data  collection.  It  will provide a conceptual map to approach citizen engagement with big data from  an  interdisciplinary  perspective,  combining  political  sociology, media studies, and science and technology studies.
