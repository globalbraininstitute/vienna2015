## Megathread: A Cross-Platform, Cross-Discipline, Semantic Technology for Facilitating a Super-Intelligent Global Brain 

### Abstact:

The evolution of mankind is geared towards reaching a singular goal; a future prosperity based on the omnipotent potentials of the Internet as a super-intelligent, “Global Brain.” What is imperative to reaching this potential is discovering the safest and most effective approach to organizing people and information resources over the Internet’s open-architecture. 

#### The Social Web Problem

The #1 challenge of socializing the Web lies in its decentralized nature. With so many people using the Web for just about everything, how can we trust an unregulated, open-environment to deliver us the right connections while protecting our personal and proprietary information? 

The current “Social Web 2.0” is a patchwork of online communities and social technologies that appeal to different interest groups and various aspects of society. Blogs, social networks, search engines and community platforms all improve our ability to connect with people and information in ways that were never possible. Whether it is education, science, technology, sports, entertainment, news, media, business, enterprises, governments, healthcare, etc., every aspect and discipline of society is relying on the usefulness of the Social Web. However, while the Internet offers unlimited potentials, the overall lack of a safe and effective standard that ties all people, communities, and social technologies together is limiting it from becoming a super-intelligent, Global Brain.

Misinformation, fraud, maliciousness, and abuse to personal and proprietary information are all bi-products of a fragmented Web 2.0 society. Without the ability to accurately understand who people really are and what they really seek across different platforms and without threatening privacy, the Web lacks integrity, personalization, and meaning. This absence of decentralized organization has resulted in problems such as invasive advertising, spam, unwanted exposure, improper search results, inadequate social connections, and a plethora of other challenges. This inherent challenge is also limiting online education from providing life-long learning environments, personalizing the classroom, and adapting curriculum to real-world events and applications. While leading edge Web technologies continue to try and improve our daily lives, “filter bubbles,” trending topics, and generalized recommendations are hindering individuality, novelty and unique opportunities from rising to the top. If the Web supported a universal standard for recognizing the authenticity and credibility of people and information resources it would become the conduit for accelerating individual and cultural development, enhancing institutional objectives, providing global democracy, while discovering novel solutions to complex problems on a global scale.

#### The Key to Socializing the Web

When it comes to understanding the safest and most effective approach to organizing people and information resources across the Internet’s open architecture our greatest teacher is actually nature. Contrary to the centralized and proprietary nature of civilization, all natural systems follow the non-linear, decentralized principles of self-organization. This process is superior to centralized organization because it provides a maximum efficiency/minimal energy model, ensures systematic sustainability, and promotes emergent outcomes to inherent challenges that arise throughout the system.

Through utilizing online dialogue as an accurate source for identifying, understanding, and connecting people and information resources, civilization can achieve the same sustainable, prosperous, and benevolent outcomes that are apparent in all natural self-organizing systems. This is because dialogue is fundamental to the cognitive exchange and developmental process; dialogue is how human beings develop meaning and understanding, and therefore, it is essential to our own self-organization.

In regards to the human condition dialogue is singular and the source of semantics. Therefore, as online communities and social technologies continue to expand and include every person in every discipline that define civilization, utilizing the online dialogue that occurs over each and every platform is the key to building a Singular-Semantic Web; which is synonymous to a super-intelligent, Global Brain. 

#### A Global Brain Hypothesis

The key to the Global Brain lies in a singular-semantic Web technology that is scalable to any community platform and can identify, understand and interconnect the various social objects that comprise the social Web.  This depends upon the fundamental process of how people exchange knowledge through information over the Internet.  Online dialogue provides the key to measuring accurate representations of knowledge, interest and influence across any platform, in any give subject, without threatening privacy.  This can be applied to all users, posts, discussions, communities, groups, blogs, articles, forums, and even social media objects such as images, videos, music, products, and more.  What this would result in is a universal knowledge resource that is exponentially more effective in supporting personal, social and business objectives across the Web.  This is when the Internet will signify a socially empowering phenomenon; a fully integrated and super-intelligent, “Global Brain” which can organically match people’s problems with solutions and values with needs on a global scale.

#### Megathread: A Singular-Semantic Web Technology

After a life changing experience I had in 1999, I’ve dedicated all my efforts towards applying self-organizing principles to the Internet’s open-architecture. What I’ve eventually derived is an award-winning technology called Megathread, which is designed to ubiquitously integrate all users, posts, discussions, communities, groups, blogs, articles, forums, etc., across all disciplines that utilize the social Web. Megathread’s core functionality is its 3rd-person algorithm, which “naturally” recognizes accurate representations of knowledge, interest and influence for people and information resources in any subject of interest, and this is based upon levels of engagement in online discussions. This organic process provides superior understanding (semantics) and universal interconnectivity (singular) yet is totally benign to personal and proprietary information.

#### Autonomy, Privacy and Filtering

Megathread provides a unique sense of social autonomy for users, communities, groups, discussions, and other social media objects that utilize its technology. Unlike other social platforms, Megathread offers its users 100% control over the data it generates about them and/or their communities. Through profiles, individual users and community managers are granted an unprecedented level of filtering (scope and scalability) and this allows for the safest and most effective connections between other social objects that Megathread recognizes.

After data is filtered through profile protection, it is then organized into a semantic data stream that can be utilized by 3rd-parties such as search engines, advertisers, marketers, researchers, recruiters, educators, etc. This ensures a safe, accurate and meaningful resource for online interconnectivity, which would eventually eliminate the need for excessive data mining and intrusive applications that violate personal and proprietary interests.

#### The Current State of Megathread

Megathread is a minimal viable product that is self-funded. As anticipated, a next-generation (Global Brain) technology of this scale demands a significant level of support in order to reach its market in a timely and effective fashion. Along with this proposal, we are currently seeking funding primarily dedicated towards strategy, marketing and business development.

Megathread has been tested on a number of different real-world blogs and discussion platforms, and has proven to provide a unique ability to qualify and quantify various social objects, (people, posts, discussions, communities, etc.) based on levels of engagement in the subjects that are being discussed. Our models demonstrate a “zero degree of separation” between these various objects over different platforms based on levels of relevance. This cross-platform ability to recognize authenticity and credibility for different social objects, and to provide immediate integration between these objects, demonstrates the ability to address the Web 2.0 problems discussed above.

Support in the form of recognition by the Global Brain Summit along with future funding will go a long way towards reaching our goal of building a Singular-Sematic Web (Global Brain) over the next 5 years. Our initial strategy is to seed Megathread in online communities in education, research, and technology as a tool for credentialing subject matter/experts, personalizing the classroom, skill-matching, and bridging the knowledge gap between education and the real world. (For Online Education see: [http://www.collaborativeedu.org](http://www.collaborativeedu.org) and [http://www.megathread.com/open-social-credentials-future-online-education-socially-empowering-potentials-web/](http://www.megathread.com/open-social-credentials-future-online-education-socially-empowering-potentials-web/)) Once Megathread’s credentials are established in these fundamental communities it would provide a viral effect upon all other platforms in the various disciplines that comprise the Social Web. Our business model is based on licensing fees to larger online communities and 3rd-parties (which would exclude individual users, educational institutions and non-profits.) Megathread’s semantic data stream will also be available as open-source data for a plethora of 3rd-party applications that would fit the needs of various disciplines and interests.

#### Conclusion

Through a combined effort of disciplines in education, research, science, health care, social media, government, etc., Megathread can maximize knowledge resources, accelerate individual/cultural development, provide unprecedented skill matching, facilitate global democracy, and promote novel solutions to complex problems on a global scale. Through the self-organization of people, knowledge and information resources, Megathread can address the inherent challenges of socializing the Web while playing a significant role in creating a super-intelligent, Global Brain.

#### Future Applications

Since Megathread is based upon the fundamental process of how humans develop meaning and understanding (the cognitive exchange process,) its principles can be utilized to help create super-intelligence and benevolence in: Artificial Intelligence, socio-economics, distributed governance, personal development, sustainability, etc. We believe these same self-organizing principles can play a significant role in achieving exponential benefits (maximum efficiency/minimal energy, ensuring systematic sustainability, promoting emergent/benevolent outcomes) in a multitude of different applications such as biological ontologies, nanotechnologies, drones, etc.
