## Global Brain, Global Mind, Global Consciousness: Fact or Fiction. An assessment

### Abstact:

Two parallel streams of enquiry pertaining to Global Consciousness/Mind/Brain are converging. One stream of enquiry is establishing the emergence of this phenomena as a logical outcome of cultural evolution, the penultimate stage in evolution that started with the big bang and along the arrow of time passed through the particulate, galactic, stellar, planetary, chemical and biological stages. The final upcoming stage being “ethical evolution”. All along adhering to and complying with the basic rules of selection for fitness and survival, in the narrow conventional sense. The stage of cultural evolution is of competition among memes, and selection for fitness of a set of them and the concurrent "emergence" of a metaphoric or figurative concept of Global Consciousness/Mind/Brain that is synthetic in nature, enabled by technological connectivity of the billions of humans in cyberspace, causing increasing collaboration and coordination on a variety of issues that have a bearing on the “survival” of the species. 

The second stream of enquiry, is premised on an integration of ancient philosophical speculations. This second stream seeks to establish an implicit and Apriori universal consciousness/mind/brain, the presence of a field that is strictly “information” with non-local communication between minds, and an evolutionary process that has always manifested the phenomena of sociality, connection and group altruism, but now more evident than ever because of the exponential increases in human connectivity on the planet. More important, this enlarged and more potent description of the phenomena also raises the possibility that the drive to “thrival” is inherent, possible and perhaps inevitable. 

For sure,  there is no incontrovertible proof of this apriori universal consciousness as yet, and indeed may never come about. What can be safely stated however is that these two phenomena are not in opposition to each other, rather, these two phenomena coud be considered as sequential and therefore do not detract from the consideration of these phenomena as it pertains to the idea of Global Brain, Global Mind, Global Consciousness.

This paper will examine the nature and content of these two phenomena.
