                    <p><font size=4>The <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_brain" target="_blank">Global Brain</a> can be defined as the self-organizing network formed by all people on this planet together with the information and communication technologies that connect and support them. As the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" target="_blank">Internet</a> becomes faster, smarter, and more encompassing, it increasingly links its users into a single information processing system, which functions like a nervous system for the planet Earth. The intelligence of this system is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence" target="_blank">collective</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_cognition" target="_blank">distributed</a>: it is not localized in any particular individual, organization or computer system. It rather emerges from the interactions between all its components—a property characteristic of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_systems" target="_blank">complex adaptive system</a>. Such a distributed intelligence may be able to tackle current and emerging global problems that have eluded more traditional approaches. Yet, at the same time it will create technological and social challenges that are still difficult to imagine, transforming our society in all aspects.</font></p>
